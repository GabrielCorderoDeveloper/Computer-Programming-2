1- Give a code example that uses abstract
abstract class Animal {
    public abstract void sound();

    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eating");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}

2- Give a code example that uses interface
interface Vehicle {
    void start();
}

class Car implements Vehicle {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Car started");
    }
}

3- When would we choose one over the other?

When we share common behavior or  variables is better to use abstract since we only have to write the code once. 

Is best to use an interface when we only care about the behavior and not the code. Interfaces are better when different classes need to follow the same rule.
