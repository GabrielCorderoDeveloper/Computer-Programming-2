Assigment 2 Gabriel Cordero

1- Watch and take notes (bullet points are fine) for section 1.  The key here is to understand the ideas we will be discusses throughout this course at an abstract level.

Is easier to think of programming as a list of steps to follow

With object oriented we have more reusability. 

We can have different objects that are similar but with different properties.

Classes are similar to blueprints, the determine what an object would do and look like.

With abstraction you can hide unnecessary details and focus on what matters.

You can protect data using encapsulation.

With polymorphism objects behave different.


2- What is the benefit of using an array?
It let's you store multiple values under one name. Everything is organized in order, so it is easy to access the values.

3- What is the benefit of creating objects and classes?
With objects and classes we can reuse code and stay organized. It also makes the program easier to understand and maintain.

4- Create a class called Bank. It should have a variable for amount, a method for deposit and a method for withdrawal.  There should also be an array of doubles that keeps track of every deposit or withdrawal.  Create a method called listInteractions that prints the array of deposits and withdrawals. The deposits should be positive and the withdrawals should be negative.

public class Bank {
    double amount;
    double[] history = new double[100];
    int count = 0;

    public void deposit(double value) {
        amount += value;
        history[count] = value;
        count++;
    }

    public void withdrawal(double value) {
        amount -= value;
        history[count] = -value;  // negative because it's a withdrawal
        count++;
    }

    public void listInteractions() {
        for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
            System.out.println(history[i]);
        }
    }
}
